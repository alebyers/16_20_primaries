# FEC Democratic Primary Contributions Analysis: 2016 & 2020

## Purpose of the Project

This repository explores financial contributions to Democratic presidential primary candidates during the 2016 and 2020 election cycles. The project has three key goals:

1. To investigate whether there is a relationship between individual-level contributions and voting outcomes across the U.S.
1. To evaluate the potential electoral impact of the 2016 voter purge in Brooklyn on the Hillary Clinton vs. Bernie Sanders primary results.
1. To examine how ActBlue, a PAC-like fundraising platform, appears in the Federal Election Commission’s (FEC) individual contributions dataset.
